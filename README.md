# SCBI_Calculator

I've been playing this game for several years and felt the need to create a calculator that will compute the total number of raw items needed to complete construction/reconstruction of buildings. At some point, I plan on implementing a time calculator and a login to store the information. Most of this will be in PHP, JS (not sure which one), and database implemented in MySQL.
